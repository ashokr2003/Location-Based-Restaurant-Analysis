# 🌍 Location-Based Restaurant Analysis - Cognifyz Internship

## 📌 Project Overview
As part of the Machine Learning Internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**, this project focuses on analyzing restaurant data based on **geographical distribution**, including city-level insights such as:

- Restaurant distribution by latitude & longitude
- Top cities with the most restaurants
- Average rating by city
- Average cost for two people by city

---

## 🧠 Objective
Perform a location-based analysis of restaurants using visualization and statistical summaries.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Plotly Express
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🧼 Data Preprocessing
- Dropped irrelevant columns like `Switch to order menu`, `Rating color`, etc.
- Removed 9 null values from the `Cuisines` column
- Focused on key fields: `City`, `Locality`, `Longitude`, `Latitude`, `Cuisines`, `Aggregate rating`, `Average Cost for two`, and `Votes`

---

## 📊 Analysis Highlights

### ✅ 1. Visualize All Restaurant Locations
- Static scatter plot using latitude and longitude
- Interactive map using Plotly to explore distribution

### ✅ 2. City-Wise Statistics
- 📍 **Top 10 cities by restaurant count** – New Delhi ranked #1
- ⭐ **Top 10 cities by average rating** – Tagaytay leads with high user satisfaction
- 💸 **Top 10 cities by average cost** – Jakarta has the highest cost for two

---

## 📌 Key Insights
- New Delhi is a restaurant hub.
- Some cities have high ratings but fewer restaurants — opportunities for expansion.
- Cost vs rating analysis helps identify premium vs budget regions.

---

## 🎯 Outcome
✅ Gained valuable insights from location-based filtering and data visualization.
